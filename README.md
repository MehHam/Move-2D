# Mass-Affect:
We have developed at the CRI-Paris MobileLab a multi-pedagogical serious game. It is based on the control of the Center Of Mass of players, a physical concept which links participants in real-time. The major pedagogical point is to organize the learning process around: corporal and oral language, action through physical activity, logical structuration of thinking and world exploration using gaming.

In this work, we describe a multi-pedagogical serious game based
on a real-time collaborative combination of movements. is two dimensional game aims to improve body comprehension of younger
pupils and mathematics for the older ones. In the rst case, psychomotor development might be enhanced. In the second one,
mathematical analysis will be beer understood by vectorial visualization of movement. In both cases, collaboration between players
is the most important and original key to success unlike games
based on competition.

Considering two equivalent masses for two players P1 and P2, 8 levels have been developed up to now.

# Beginner Pedagogical Progression :
For equivalent masses, the position of the center of mass is always given by the average position between player P1 and P2. In this context, the team composed of P1 and P2 follow a first tutorial of pick-ups collecting. Then they have to reconstruct mapping trajectories (circular, oscillating along a simple axis or totally random) in level 2. Finally precision activity takes place. This activity consists of collecting and motion mapping while avoiding death zones. 

# Intermediate Pedagogical Progression :
Changing the mass ratio will naturally give richer experience in terms of motion comprehension and a team leader experience in team building processes. Intermediate levels give access to mass manipulation by pick-up collecting, so that the team can understand the mechanism.

# Expert Pedagogical Progression :
Changing the mass ratio is accessible on real time for each player and the center of mass is partially hidden so that players can explore their understanding of the concept and their collaborative ability.
