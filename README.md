# Center Of Mass
Center Of Mass GameWe have developed at the CRI-Paris MobileLab a multi-pedagogical serious game. It is based on the collaborative aspect of the center of mass in physics applied to first grade pupils and their elders in high school. The major point is to organize the learning process around: corporal and oral language, action through physical activity, logical structuration of thinking and world exploration using gaming.

The game is available for a 2 players collaborations. 
A player needs to lunch an instance on his own platform (Android smartphone or tab, Apple, windows) and join the server instance. To summarize, two players game needs three instances to play.

Considering two equivalent masses for the two players P1 and P2, three levels have been developed up to now. For equivalent masses, the position of the center of mass is always given by the average position between player P1 and P2. In this context, the team composed of P1 and P2 follow a first tutorial of pick-ups collecting. Then they have to reconstruct mapping trajectories (circular, oscillating along a simple axis or totally random) in level 2. Finally precision activity takes place. This activity consists of collecting and motion mapping while avoiding death zones.
